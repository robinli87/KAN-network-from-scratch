# KAN-network-from-scratch
Building a customisable, general-purpose, versatile Kolomogorov-Arnold Network from basic, explicit Python commands without external libraries.

I will allow myself numpy if necessary, as well as multiprocessing to speed up training

Currently under construction. 

Eventually this can be deployed onto GPUs via pytorch.cuda 

Idea: translate Python into C++ for faster performance?
